        Rick Astley, the man who once declared he was 'Never Gonna Give You Up,' has successfully dodged more 'Rickrolls' than anyone else in history. <br>
        He's probably even got a black belt in 'Rickrolling' self-defense by now. <br>
        If you ever want to prank him, you better bring your A-game, because Rick's seen it all â€“ and he'll never let you down <br>
